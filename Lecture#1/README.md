# Lecture #1: Introduction to Java and Android Development

## Topics Covered

1. **Java Basics**
   - Setting up the development environment (JDK, Android Studio)
   - Variables and naming rules
   - Data types (byte, short, char, int, long, float, double)
   - Typecasting (Implicit and Explicit)

2. **Operators in Java**
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
   - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
   - Comparison/Conditional operators (>, <, <=, >=, ==, !=)
   - Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   - Binary operators (&, |, ^)
   - Unary operators (++, --)
   - Ternary operator (? :)

3. **Control Flow**
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Arrays (single and multi-dimensional)
   - Functions/Methods
   
4. **Object-Oriented Programming Basics**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Attributes and Methods
   - Constructors
   - Four Pillars of OOP:
     - Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data
     - Inheritance - Creating new classes from existing classes
     - Polymorphism - Using a single interface for different data types
     - Abstraction - Hiding implementation details and exposing only functionality

## Sample Code
The `SampleCode` directory contains cleanly organized examples demonstrating these concepts:

1. `HelloWorld.java` - Basic Java program structure
2. `VariableRules.java` - Variable declaration and naming rules
3. `DataTypes.java` - Different data types in Java
4. `Typecasting.java` - Implicit and explicit type conversion
5. `Operators.java` - Examples of different operators
6. `Loops.java` - Different types of loops in Java
7. `Arrays.java` - Working with single and multi-dimensional arrays
8. `Functions.java` - Methods and their usage in Java
9. `OOPConcepts.java` - Object-Oriented Programming concepts with all four pillars

## Variable Naming Rules
1. Can use A-Z (uppercase letters)
2. Can use a-z (lowercase letters)
3. Can use 0-9 (numbers, but not at the start)
4. Cannot use spaces, use _ (underscore) instead
5. Can use $ (special character)
