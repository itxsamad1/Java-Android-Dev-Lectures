# Lecture #1: Introduction to Java and Android Development

## Overview
This lecture covers the fundamentals of Java programming and introduces Android application development. It lays the foundation for the entire course by exploring core concepts that will be used throughout our Android development journey.

## Topics Covered

1. **Java Basics**
   - Setting up the development environment (JDK, Android Studio)
   - Variables and naming rules
   - Data types (byte, short, char, int, long, float, double)
   - Typecasting (Implicit and Explicit)

2. **Operators in Java**
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
   - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
   - Comparison/Conditional operators (>, <, <=, >=, ==, !=)
   - Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   - Binary operators (&, |, ^)
   - Unary operators (++, --)
   - Ternary operator (? :)

3. **Introduction to Loops and Arrays**

## Sample Code
The `SampleCode` directory contains examples demonstrating these concepts:
- `HelloWorld.java`: Basic Java program structure
- `Variables.java`: Variable declaration and naming rules
- `DataTypes.java`: Different data types in Java
- `Typecasting.java`: Implicit and explicit type conversion
- `Operators.java`: Examples of different operators
- `Section6B.java`: Sample code from the lecture

## Practice Exercises
1. Create a Java program that demonstrates all variable naming rules
2. Write a program to demonstrate different types of operators
3. Create a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations

## Variable Naming Rules
1. Can use A-Z (uppercase letters)
2. Can use a-z (lowercase letters)
3. Can use 0-9 (numbers, but not at the start)
4. Cannot use spaces, use _ (underscore) instead
5. Can use $ (special character)
